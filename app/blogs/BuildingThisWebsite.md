## React vs Next

This is geared more towards beginner developers like myself. 

So what should you choose when creating your websites? Well it really depends on the type of website you're building. There are pros and cons to using each and I'll go over briefly each so that you can correctly choose what technology to use for your website. 

React is a JavaScript libary that builds user interfaces. You'll want to choose this when you want more control over your application's structure and behaviour. 

Use React when you desire

- Single page applications like dashboards, internal company tools, or highly interactive frontends.
- Full control over your tech stack. You're able to pick and choose exactly what build tools, routing libraries and others when using React. 
- Where search engine optimization is not a primary concern due to fact that React renders content on the client side, which is not ideal for SEO.
- When using an existing backend framework, React is the ideal choice to pair with in the frontend. 

Now onto Next. 

Next on the other hand is a full stack React framework. This builds upon the react library to give us full stack features like server side rendering, static site generation, routing and API handling. It simplifies common web development patterns

Use Next when you desire

- Search engine optimization and performance. Next uses server side rendering or static site generation which helps in Google's search engine optimization as well as faster load times Examples include ecommerce, marketing sites, blogs or news sites. 
- You want a full stack web application out of the box. Initializing a Next project creates you backend and frontend features out of the box. 
- Next also has the ability to scale it's applications where performance is a priority.

So please take into consideration with what you're building and choose the correct technology for your website. I personally used React in building this website as this is just a personal website. I don't need extensive SEO performance and I'm not looking for a fully formed full stack website experience. I'm able to swap out and integrate new pieces into my website easily because of this where Next would be a bit more challenging to do. 

So good luck on your web development journey and thanks for reading.
